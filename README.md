# CPU
March 2019

For my CS250 class (Computer Architecture), I designed and implemented a 16-bit, word-addressed, RISC-architecture CPU using only primitive gates, D flip-flops, and RAM/ROM that is capable of instructions including: load/store word, arithmetic shift left/right by [amount], branch if equal, or less than, add (immediate), subtract, jump, jump and link, jump return address. See CPU-design for more details.
